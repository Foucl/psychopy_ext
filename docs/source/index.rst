Welcome to psychopy_ext documentation!
========================================

Unlike PsychoPy which offers a great flexibility in how you approach creating
experiments, psychopy_ext was developed to offer a unified framework for
designing, building, and analyzing neuroscience experiments. An established
framework saves time and helps to avoid mistakes. Surely "one size fits all"
approach can never suit everybody's needs but this library should at least
greatly simplify creation of your custom scripts.

Features
--------

- Easy to rerun everything
- Neat project organization
- Templates for building and analyzing experiments (behavioral & fMRI)
- Built-in simple models of vision (Pixel-wise difference, GaborJet, and HMAX'99)
- Custom needs? Inherit & customize: everything is a class!
- Automatic running of experiments
- Automatic GUI and command-line interpreter
- Simplified descriptive statistics
- Pretty plotting
