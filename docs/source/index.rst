Welcome to psychopy_ext documentation!
========================================
Unlike PsychoPy which offers a great flexibility in how you approach creating experiments, psychopy_ext was developed to offer a unified framework for designing, building, and analyzing neuroscience experiments. An established framework saves time and helps to avoid mistakes. Surely "one size fits all" approach can never suit everybody's needs but this library should at least greatly simplify creation of your custom scripts.

Features
--------

- Neat project organization
- Templates for building experiments
- Automatic modes for running experiments
- Automatic GUI and command-line interpreter
- Simplified descriptive statistics
- Pretty plotting
- Built-in simple models of vision (Pixel-wise difference, GaborJet, and HMAX'99)
